***Cars Data Visualization*** 

This project uses HTML and D3.js to present an interactive web-based visualisation of automotive features. Providing customers with informative visualisations of different automotive properties, such as weight distribution, horsepower, and fuel efficiency, is the aim. Users may examine the data by manufacturer, origin, and other car parameters thanks to the interactive filters.
